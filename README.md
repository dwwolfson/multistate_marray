## Multistate M-array survival models

### Project Description
This github repository will serve as a semi-structured place to archive working code and associated files for a project 
investigating model forumulaations for survival analysis of mark-recapture datasets, particularly those with both 
dead recovery (i.e., harvest) and live encounter (e.g., recaptures, resightings) data streams. We aim to produce scripts
that are flexible to be used with banding datasets were known age/stage may not be present in individuals prior to breeding.

This repository will be private while code is being developed, and will eventually be made public and synced to an online archive such as 
Zenodo that will curate a static snapshot of the code used for a publication, also providing a stable DOI link as a permanent archived resource.
